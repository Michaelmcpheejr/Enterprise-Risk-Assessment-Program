# Risk Methodology

## Risk Identification

Risks are identified using a hybrid domain-based and asset-specific approach.

## Risk Statement Format

If [event occurs], then [business impact results] due to [root cause].

## Scoring Model

- Likelihood: 1–3
- Impact: 1–5
- Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact

### Risk Rating Bands
- Low: 1–5
- Medium: 6–14
- High: 15–25

High risks automatically escalate to leadership.
